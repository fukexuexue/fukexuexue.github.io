When I write, I usually start from the very beginning. Maybe there is a synopsis in my mind, but I don’t structure what I am going to write on paper, before I start. There must be a hook in the beginning, that you can return to later in the text, and it’s all about finding the stories. Some stories I already know of, others I have to find. I have on occasion had a co-writer who has helped me with finding and formulating stories. My stories usually contain some current research but mainly they are aimed at educating the reader about science. One of my colleagues usually says that people are interested in other people, so that’s what you find in my popular science texts. There also needs to be a good mix of people and places around the world and there can be stories of love and death.
