When I write, I usually begin without a structured plan, though I might have a synopsis in mind. I believe in starting with a hook that can be revisited later in the text. Writing is about discovering storiesâ€”some I already know, others I must find. Occasionally, a co-writer assists me in finding and shaping these stories. My narratives often include current research, aiming to educate readers about science. A colleague once said that people are interested in other people, which is why my popular science texts focus on human stories. It's important to include a diverse mix of people and places, with themes of love and death.
